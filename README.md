# Neural Network for Converting Kilometers to Miles

## Description

This is a school project where we created a **simple neural network** that learns to convert kilometers to miles. The program uses the TensorFlow and NumPy libraries to build and execute the neural network.

## How It Works

The program takes a kilometer value as input and uses the trained neural network to convert this value into miles. The network is trained with a set of example values (kilometers and their mile equivalents) and adjusts its internal weights to learn this conversion independently.

## Installation

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
```

## Execution

To run the program, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

```bash
python neural.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a kilometer value, and the program will output the equivalent miles based on the prediction from the neural network.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to understand and apply the basics of **machine learning** and **neural networks**. It demonstrates how to build, train, and use a simple model to make predictions based on sample data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

## Example

Here is an example output from the program:

```
Please enter a kilometer value: 10
10 kilometers is approximately 6.21371 miles
```
